Strong academic profile (78.8% of students in Top 10%).
Moderate selectivity: 39% acceptance rate.
Balanced student-faculty ratio (12.8).
Mid-level expenses (~$21,447).
High graduation rate (87.6%).
This cluster likely includes competitive but affordable colleges 
with strong  academics and good outcomes

Cluster 1: Less Selective, Low-Cost Colleges
Weaker academic profile (38.8% Top 10% students).
High acceptance rate (70%).
High student-faculty ratio (19.3) – possibly larger classes.
Lowest expenses (~$9,953).
Moderate graduation rate (71.8%).
These might be public universities or regional colleges with
open access  policies , lower tuition , and fewer resources per student

Cluster 2: Elite, Expensive Colleges
Very strong academic profile (89% Top 10%).
Very selective (only ~27% acceptance).
Low student-faculty ratio (10.0) – small class sizes.
Very high expenses (~$49,897).

# Clustering Performance
# =======================

'''
If we have external ground truth labels to compute
supervised performance metrics like Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) or Normalized Mutual Information (NMI).
However, since your dataset likely does not have true cluster labels (as this is an unsupervised task),
we’ll use internal evaluation metrics such as:

Silhouette Score – Measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster vs. other clusters.

Davies-Bouldin Index – Measures the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster (lower is better).

Calinski-Harabasz Index – Ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion (higher is better).
'''

# Calinski-Harabasz Index – Ratio of between-cluster
# dispersion to within-cluster dispersion (higher is better).

silhouette = silhouette_score(df_norm, h_complete.labels_)
db_index = davies_bouldin_score(df_norm, h_complete.labels_)
ch_index = calinski_harabasz_score(df_norm, h_complete.labels_)


print("\n--- Clustering Performance Metrics ---")
print(f"Silhouette Score                : {silhouette:.4f} (range: -1 to +1, higher is better)")

# Silhouette Score
'''
Range: -1 to +1

Interpretation:
A value near +1 indicates that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters (i.e., good clustering).
A value near 0 means the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two clusters.
A value less than 0 means the sample might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

score (0.2930):
Low-to-moderate clustering quality.
There is some structure, but the clusters overlap or are not well separated.
Possibly, the number of clusters (3) is not optimal.
'''
print(f"Davies-Bouldin Index            : {db_index:.4f} (Lower is better)")
#Davies-Bouldin Index            : 1.0286
'''

Interpretation:
Measures intra-cluster similarity vs. inter-cluster difference.
Lower values are better.
A value around 1 is acceptable, but:
< 1 is considered good
> 2 is usually poor (clusters are too similar or not well separated).
score (1.0286):
Average clustering performance.
Clusters are not very tight or well-separated, but they’re not completely bad either.
bad either
Could be improved by:
Trying different Linkage methods (average, ward, etc.)
Trying a different number of clusters.

'''
print(f"Calinski-Harabasz Index   : {ch_index:.4f} (higher is better)")
#Calinski-Harabasz Index   : 24.6202
'''
Range: 0 to ∞

Interpretation:
Measures the ratio of between-cluster dispersion to within-cluster dispersion.

Higher values are better – they indicate well-separated, compact clusters.

No universal scale, but values:

> 100 = strong separation  
10–50 = moderate separation
<10 =weak
your score (24.62)
moderate clustring structure
not great , but better than random or trivial grouping
